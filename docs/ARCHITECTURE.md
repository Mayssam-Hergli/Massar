Each module (MS1, MS2, MS3) is built as an **agent**: a Claude model
constrained by a system prompt to only call deterministic tool functions.
The agent never invents a score, a classification, or a retrieved
resource — it orchestrates tool calls and writes natural-language
explanations from the tool outputs. This keeps every number traceable
and auditable, which is required by the judging criteria (Explainability
& Scoring Rigour, Evaluation & Rigour).

---

## Shared database — PostgreSQL

5 tables, this is the integration point between all modules. Modules
do not call each other directly — they read and write to these tables.

| Table | Written by | Read by | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project_profiles` | MS1, MS2 | MS2, MS3, Frontend | JSON shared state: diagnostic_answers, all 5 score objects |
| `diagnostic_outputs` | MS1 | MS2, MS3, Frontend | stage, blockers, gaps |
| `scores_history` | MS2 | MS3, Frontend | dimensions, timestamp — tracks score evolution over time |
| `roadmaps` | MS3 | Frontend, Export Service | actions, horizon (immediate/short/medium term) |
| `knowledge_base` | Person 2 (ingestion) | MS3 | pgvector embeddings of 41+ Tunisian resources |

## MS2 — Scoring Engine (owned by Person 1 / me)

### Data contract

**Reads from `project_profiles.diagnostic_answers`** — written by MS1.
Exact field names confirmed with MS1 owner (see open questions below
if not yet confirmed).

**Writes to `project_profiles`** — 5 separate keys:
`market_score`, `commercial_score`, `innovation_score`,
`scalability_score`, `green_score`.

Important detail discovered while building anomaly checks: raw
categorical answers (e.g. `offer_need_alignment`, `product_maturity`)
live in `diagnostic_answers` as strings. The score objects in
`all_scores` only hold **numeric** sub-score values — they do not
preserve the original category string. Any anomaly check that needs
the raw category (not just the numeric score) must read it from
`diagnostic_answers`, not reverse-engineer it from `all_scores`.
This is documented inline in `anomaly.py`.

### File structure

```
backend/scoring/
  green.py          DONE — pure function, UNDP formula
                     validated against 2 UNDP workshop examples
                     (Kilim tissage -> 7.0 total / 81.2 display /

                     31.2 display / "Impact modéré")

  market.py          DONE — pure function, 3 weighted sub-criteria
                     (taille_marche 30%, validation_client 40%,
                     modele_revenus 30%). Validation is weighted
                     highest by design — a strong market_size score
                     cannot mask zero customer validation.

  commercial.py        DONE — pure function, 4 weighted sub-criteria
                       (proposition_valeur 30%, maturite_produit 25%,
                       strategie_pricing 25%, alignement_besoin 20%).
                       Tested with strong, weak, and a deliberately
                       contradictory profile (product fully built,
                       never validated) that fed directly into a new
                       anomaly check.

  innovation.py         DONE — pure function, 3 weighted sub-criteria
                        (nouveaute_locale 35%, intensite_technologique 30%,

                        barrier_to_entry: pending+5, granted+15, capped at
                        100. 5 tests including IP cap verification and
                        banker's rounding checks (71.8, 75.2).

  scalability.py         DONE — pure function, 3 weighted sub-criteria
                         (replicabilite 35%, dependance_manuelle 30%,
                         potentiel_geographique 35%). manual_dependency
                         uses an inverted scale (high=10, none=100) — less
                         human intervention required = higher score.
                         4 tests including contradiction profile (73.0
                         composite masks dep_man=10, caught by anomaly.py)
                         and explicit inversion verification.

  anomaly.py               DONE — centralized cross-module anomaly
                           detection. Runs ONCE, after all 5 scores
                           exist, not duplicated per-module. Takes
                           diagnostic_answers + all_scores dict.
                           5 checks implemented (16 tests, all passing):
                             - market_no_validation (high)
                             - revenue_no_clients (high)

                               offer_need_alignment == "none".
                               Reads offer_need_alignment from
                               diagnostic_answers directly (see data
                               contract note above). Distinct from
                               market_no_validation: a founder can
                               pass (a) via general customer interviews
                               while still failing (e) because they
                               never validated THIS product against a
                               real need.

  engine.py         DONE — compute_all_scores(diagnostic_answers) -> dict.
                   Pure deterministic aggregator, zero LLM calls.
                   Calls all 5 modules in fixed order, then anomaly
                   detection. Returns:

                   return {composite: None, error: "...", sub_scores: {}}
                   without crashing the pipeline. Serves as regression
                   baseline — agent.py must produce identical composites.
                   3 tests: strong (no anomalies), overconfident founder
                   (3 anomalies, market LOW), incomplete (2 dims error,
                   engine survives).

                             + execute_tool(tool_name, tool_input) dispatcher.
                             Tool input for the 5 scoring tools IS the flat
                             diagnostic_answers dict — each function ignores
                             extra keys, so the agent passes the full dict
                             to every tool. detect_all_anomalies input:
                             {"diagnostic_answers": {...}, "all_scores": {...}}.
                             Guard: raises ValueError if all_scores missing
                             any of the 5 expected dimension keys — enforces
                             "call anomaly last" at execution level, not just
                             in the prompt. Error isolation mirrors engine.py:
                             missing fields -> {composite: None, error: ...}.
                             7 tests: schema shape, routing (all 6 tools),
                             guard (3 cases), consistency vs engine.py.

  system_prompt.py             DONE — SCORING_SYSTEM_PROMPT constant
                               (French, provider-agnostic, 5408 chars).

                               inventing scores — every number comes
                               from a tool call. Fixed call order
                               enforced (market -> commercial ->
                               innovation -> scalability -> green ->
                               anomaly). JSON-only output: justifications

  agent.py                       PENDING — the agent loop: calls

                                 never skips a tool, writes NL
                                 justification only after getting
                                 real numbers back from tools

```

### Output JSON shape — common to all 5 score modules

Pure scoring functions (green, market, commercial, innovation,
scalability) return ONLY their own numbers. No anomaly_flags key —
that was a mistake initially made in market.py and has been removed.
Anomaly detection is centralized in anomaly.py and runs after all 5
scores are computed.

```json
{
  "composite": 67.0,
  "sub_scores": {
    "criterion_name": {"value": 20, "weight": 0.40, "max": 100}
  }
}
```

Green Score has additional fields on top of this shape (undp_raw_total,
undp_classification, pillars instead of sub_scores — see green.py).

The anomaly check output (added separately, after all 5 scores exist):

```json
{
  "anomaly_flags": [
    {"code": "market_no_validation", "message": "...", "severity": "high"}
  ]
}
```

The NL justification text is added by the agent layer (agent.py), not
by the pure scoring functions — those stay deterministic and testable
in isolation.

## Integration points — who needs what from MS2

**MS1 (Diagnostic Engine)** — feeds MS2. I read
`diagnostic_answers` from `project_profiles`, written by them. I do
not call their agent directly.

Open question to confirm with MS1 owner: exact field names in
`diagnostic_answers`, and whether the Green Score specific fields
(energy_source, water_volume, zone_type, etc — 12 fields total) are
already collected by their questionnaire or need to be added.

**MS3 (RAG & Roadmap)** — reads MS2's output. They need two derived
signals, computed from my 5 score objects:
  - `low_scoring_dimensions` — any composite score below 50
  - `green_pillars_flagged` — any Green pillar with score >= 3

I have shared my exact output JSON shape with whoever owns MS3 so
they can build their retrieval query logic against the real contract,
not a guess.

**Frontend / Export Service** — renders my 5 score objects directly.
Needs: composite (for progress bars), sub_scores (for expandable
breakdowns), justification text, anomaly_flags (for warning badges),
and for Green Score specifically the undp_classification label with
color-coding:
  - undp_raw_total <= 7 -> success (green)
  - <= 11 -> warning (yellow)
  - <= 15 -> orange
  - <= 18 -> danger (red)
  - else -> critical (dark red)

---

## Testing approach

Every pure scoring function is validated BEFORE being wrapped as an
agent tool. Test files live alongside the module
(`test_green.py`, `test_market.py`, `test_commercial.py`,
`test_anomaly.py`). This is intentional — it proves the math is
correct independent of the agent, so when the agent is added on top,
any bug found is in the orchestration layer, not the formula.

green.py, market.py, and commercial.py are validated. anomaly.py has
16 tests covering all 5 checks, including a combined "overconfident
founder" profile where multiple anomalies fire together — useful
evidence for the "perception-reality gap detection is non-trivial"
judging bonus point.
